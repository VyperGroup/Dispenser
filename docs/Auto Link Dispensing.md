# Auto Link Dispensing

## Auto onboarding

For auto link dispensing, Dispenser will automatically add these pages

> See <https://discordeno.js.org/api_reference/generated/modules/Bot#transformguildonboarding>

1. Choose the filters you have
2. Ask if you want to opt in to auto link dispensing âœ…?

Then the user can add their school email with this command

If you don't have access to onboarding it will give you instructions for how to get your server ready for it, and in the meantime you can still use `/panel`
