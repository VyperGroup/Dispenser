# Cohorts

Cohorts are a simply a group of users that have similar user configuration (other than emails) on Filter Lock. If you are not in a cohort, when you request a link you will simply be given all the links as soon as they get blocked on other filters.

When you use a Link Bot-Locked link and Filter Detection and the trade happens, Filter Lock will use your Discord User Snowflake ID, which is in the token and know what your true filters are, automatically assigning you to the filters that you forgot to choose and you will automatically join a new, more personalized, cohort.

## Reserving

Cohorts "reserve" a unique link for themselves until another cohort has exhausted its options and needs it, so they would have their own private link (hopefully). It also prevents other

You are able to have an amnsety period for reserving a cohort that is already been claimed by another cohort. This prevents attacks from sequence spamming.

## District Cohorts

District cohorts are prioritized when reserving links. These are three ways subscribe to a district cohort.

1. Go through the crowdsourcing process and contribute information for your school district. This is the most honorable and helps others in a similar situation to you.
2. Assign yourself to a certain district using the district code
3. Provide your school email
