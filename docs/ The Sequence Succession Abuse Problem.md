# The Sequence Succession Abuse Problem

This is when a spy from a filtering company keeps blocking links in hopes to get new ones to do the same in rapid succession to quickly exhaused the link supply. Filter Lock has some protections, for example an amnesty period of reserving already claimed links, ratelimits for link distributing per cohort, and notifications of when a limit is in place. You may also opt into limits per user with special rules for different roles like classic link bots.
